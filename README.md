This is a simple webview android app to access a mobile website.

It is an Eclipse android project and all files should be committed now.

You can substiuite the strings.xml value specified with the $ symbol with the URL and build the app and it will work.

This project was more useful when adding an app as a webview was more complicated than it needed to be on earlier versions of Android.
